# MachineLearning

This contains code that compares the performance of my own Logistic regression and sklearns. I recommend using the filed polished.py to see the difference as it uses the spam data set. The script downloads the data, and you can replace this data wth your own dataset.

It will compare the accuracy of my algorithm with sklearns LogisticRegression algorithm. I use normal Gradient Descent.
